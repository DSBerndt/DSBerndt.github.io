            {{ "DFTBML is a quantum mechanical simulator. 
            It is similar to the Density Functional based Tight Binding (DFTB) model and uses 
            novel machine learning techniques to <b>lower computational cost</b> and <b>create accurate predictions</b>. 
            This combination of DFTB and machine learning inspired the name “DFTBML”. 
            DFTBML returns its resulting models in the form of SKF files. 
            This allows models trained on specific parameters to be distributed easily after production. " }}

            little training data</b> and <b>does not function as a deep learning black box</b>. 
            Accuracy plateaus with around 20,000 training configurations and the resulting models are physically interpretable." }}
