        There are currently these tutorials: <i>The Setup & Installation Guide</i>, <i>The Model Training Guide</i>, 
        <i>How to Use a Pretrained Model</i>, and <i>The Architecture of DFTBML</i>.
        <br><br>
        <i>The Setup & Installation Guide</i> contains basic instructions for first time users to get DFTBML functioning on their device.
        <br><br>
        <i>The Model Training Guide</i> is a set of instructions for users of DFTBML who wish to use the tool to train their own model from specific datasets. The guide is broken down into instructions for: preparing the raw data from your dataset, running a precomputation, training the model, and checking the accuracy of your model with DFTB+.
        <br><br>
        <i>How to Use a Pretrained Model</i> is for users who would like to use one of the parameter sets provided on the "}}
